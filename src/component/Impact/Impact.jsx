            <p>
              To help end homelessness and extreme poverty, the team at Clooper
              selected four charities closely aligned with our purpose
              statement. Clooper's founder Toks has previously volunteered for
              Shelter to feed the homeless in North Finchley, whilst our
              co-founder Matt selected The Passage at the request of his 6-year
              old daughter, who chose the charity to donate to for her annual
              â€œChristmas Lights Display".
